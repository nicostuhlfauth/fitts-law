# Experimental Review of Fitts Law

This is a testing environment I created to experimentally confirm Fitts' Law. Fitts' Law is an approch to mathematically calculate the so-called 'human performance' when using software. It analyzes the arrangement, distance and size of GUI elements and their possible influence on the achieved User Experience.

You can find the results of my test candidates in the file `Results.csv`. Please read the documentation (`FittsLaw_documentation.pdf`) to learn theoretical aspect of Fitts' Law and about the results.

This project was part of the university course 'Software Ergonomics and Usability Engineering'.

Feel free to use the code in this repository to quickly get started with your own projects.
